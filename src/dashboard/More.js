  <p class="mb-0 m-auto"><ul>
        <li className='mt-5 mb-3'>Ethiopian Airlines (Ethiopian) is the fastest growing and most profitable airline in Africa. In 2014, IATA
ranked Ethiopian as the largest airline in Africa in revenue and profit. In its operations in the past close to
seven decades, Ethiopian has been a pioneer of African aviation as an aircraft technology leader providing
the first jet service in the continent in 1962, and availing the first African B767 in 1984, the first African
B777-200LR in 2010 and the first African and second only to Japan B787 Dreamliner in 2012.</li>
<li className='mt-5 mb-3'>Ethiopian commands the lion share of the pan-African passenger and cargo network operating the
youngest and most modern fleet to 92 international destinations across five continents. Ethiopian fleet
includes ultra-modern and environmentally friendly aircraft such as the Boeing 787, Boeing 777-300ER,
Boeing 777-200LR, Boeing 777-200LR Freighter and Bombardier Q-400 double cabin with an average
fleet age of five years. In fact, Ethiopian is the first airline in Africa to own and operate these aircraft.</li>
<li className='mt-5 mb-3'>Ethiopian joined Star Alliance, the worldâ€™s largest Airline network, in December 2011. This enables
Ethiopian customers to enjoy seamless travel experience allowing them access to more than 18,500 daily
departures, 1330 destinations within 192 countries.</li>
<li className='mt-5 mb-3'>Ethiopian is currently implementing a 15-year strategic plan called Vision 2025 that will see it become
the leading airline group in Africa with seven strategic business units: Ethiopian International Passenger
Service; Ethiopian Regional Service; Ethiopian Cargo; Ethiopian MRO; Ethiopian Aviation Academy;
Ethiopian In-flight Catering Service and Ethiopian Ground Service. Ethiopian is a multi-award winning
airline, including SKYTRAX and Passenger Choice Awards in 2015 and has been registering an average
growth of 25% per annum in the past seven years</li>
